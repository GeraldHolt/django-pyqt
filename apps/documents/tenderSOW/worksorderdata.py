TEXT1 = r"""Namdini is approximately 50 km southeast of the regional town of Bolgatanga in Northern Ghana and around 60 km south of the Burkina Faso border (Figure 19). Namdini lies within the Nangodi Greenstone Belt, one of a series of southwest–northeast trending granite-greenstone belts which host significant gold mineralization in Ghana and Burkina Faso.
The Talensi district which was part of the Talensi-Nabdam district became a separate district in 2012, through Legislative Instrument LI 2110, with Tongo as the capital. The district, which is one of the thirteen Municipalities and Districts in the Upper East Region, is bordered to the north by the Bolgatanga Municipality, to the south by West and East Mamprusi Districts (both in the Northern Region), to the west by Kassena-Nankana District, and to the east by the Bawku West and Nabdam Districts. The district lies between latitude 10° 15' and 10° 60' North of the equator and longitude 0° 31' and 1° 05' West of the Greenwich Meridian and covers a land area of 838.4 km2 with a total population of 81,194, which constitutes 7.8% of the regional population. It is made up of 96 towns and villages with a settlement pattern which is predominantly rural.
The topographic relief within the project area is generally flat with gently undulating terrain, rising to the south where the area is overlain by sediments. Elevation varies from 175 to 250 meters above mean sea level (“AMSL”) with average elevation at approximately 190 m. Physiography is primarily savannah grassland characterized by short, scattered drought-resistant trees, scrub, and grass that is seasonally burned by bushfires or scorched by the sun during the long dry season."""
TEXT2 = r"""As part of the water requirements for the process plant, river water abstraction is one of the methods that will be used to supply water to the plant as well as for the camp and accommodation area. The point of abstraction has been identified which is 10,910 meters from the plant. 
Water will be abstracted by means of vertical spindle pumps, which will discharge into breakwater tanks of the booster station, 350 meters from the river in a northern direction. The booster station will accommodate the diesel generator, MCC, diesel storage, and the booster pumps which will transfer the water to the raw water storage. 
Except for areas above ground and the abstraction point, all the piping will be HDPE piping buried next to the main road to the process plant.  Piping passing underneath the main road will also be constructed from steel. The line will be equipped with valve boxes and vacuum breakers as well as the necessary scour points. Also, along the line, a T-off will be installed for the supply line to the camp.
